         I was born on 12.19.1963 in the city of Khorostkiv, Ternopil region. Since I graduated from Lviv State University in 1985, I have been working and living in Lviv (the best city of Ukraine).\n
         My experience as a C/C++ developer and electronics engineer is more 36 years. I started my professional work as a student (1983â€“1985. University research sector as a Laboratory assistant. Repairing and maintenance of electronic equipment. Software development.). Then I continued a long professional path as an engineer and programmer:\n
         1985 - 2003  RD Division in Scientific Research Institute of PHTE Lviv\n
         2005 - 2011  PDT Ukraine\n
         2012 - 2017  Cypress Microsystems\n
         2018 - 2019   Ezlo Innovation\n
         2021 - 2023  Intellias\n
          However, it is never too late to learn - now I aspire to become an Android developer as well. I want to start my own business, combined with Home Automation, to pass on to my nephew and my grandson.\n
